# Security Recommendations for MK Digital Security Platform

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the MK Digital Security Platform and provides recommendations for maintaining a secure application.

## Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Token Security**:
  - Reduced token lifetime (15 minutes for access tokens)
  - Token rotation enabled
  - Token blacklisting implemented

- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - Admin: Full access to all features
  - Editor: Can create and edit content, but cannot delete
  - Viewer: Read-only access

- **Inactivity Timer**:
  - Role-based timeouts (shorter for admin users)
  - Automatic logout after inactivity
  - Warning notifications before logout

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Anonymous users: 100 requests per day
  - Authenticated users: 1000 requests per day

- **Security Logging**:
  - Comprehensive request logging
  - Audit trail for sensitive operations
  - Redaction of sensitive information

- **CORS Configuration**:
  - Restricted to specific origins
  - Limited to necessary methods and headers

### Frontend Security

- **Secure Token Storage**:
  - Access tokens stored in memory only
  - Minimal user information in localStorage

- **Content Security Policy**:
  - Restricted script sources
  - Prevented inline scripts
  - Limited connection sources

- **Input Validation**:
  - Client-side validation
  - Server-side validation
  - Data sanitization

### Backend Security

- **Security Headers**:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: enabled

- **HTTPS Enforcement**:
  - Secure cookies
  - SSL redirection
  - HSTS implementation

- **Data Protection**:
  - Input sanitization
  - Password strength validation
  - Resource-based permissions

## Security Recommendations for Production

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Use the provided `settings_production.py` file
   - Set `DEBUG = False` in production
   - Use environment variables for secrets

2. **Database Security**:
   - Use a dedicated database user with limited permissions
   - Implement database connection pooling
   - Enable SSL for database connections

3. **Server Hardening**:
   - Keep the server updated with security patches
   - Implement a firewall
   - Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) with security configurations

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Set up logging to a centralized system
   - Implement alerts for suspicious activities
   - Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

5. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct periodic security reviews
   - Run vulnerability scans
   - Perform penetration testing

6. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Implement regular automated backups
   - Test backup restoration procedures
   - Store backups securely off-site
